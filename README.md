Human Resources (HR) Responsibilities
HR is responsible for adding and updating companies within the application. They manage employee information, including personal details, family situation, banking information, CNSS (National Social Security Fund), CIMR (Retirement and Pension Fund), and more. Additionally, HR handles the entry of employee absences and bonuses, validates leave requests and overtime hours, and addresses complaints raised by employees.

Payroll Responsibilities
The payroll team defines payroll items and their calculation rules, associating these rules with different companies to allow for varied regulations for the same item based on the company. They can visualize and export payslips in PDF or Excel format. At the end of each month, the payroll team validates payroll and freezes it for backup purposes, ensuring accurate financial records and compliance with company policies.

Employee Portal
Employees can view their personal information and check details regarding absences, leaves, overtime hours, and bonuses. They have the ability to send complaints to HR or payroll management in case of discrepancies. Employees can also submit leave requests and declare any overtime hours worked, facilitating transparent communication between staff and management regarding their work-related matters.
